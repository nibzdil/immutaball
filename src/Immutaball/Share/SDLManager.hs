-- | Some SDL functions that some functions can only be called in the OS thread
-- that set up video.
--
-- So I created a module that video setup and input event callers can route
-- their requests through, to ensure they are called from the same OS thread to
-- meet this requirement mentioned in the documentation.
--
-- Example:
-- > pollEvent :: MonadIO m => m (Maybe Event)
-- >
-- > Poll for currently pending events. You can only call this function in the OS thread that set the video mode.
